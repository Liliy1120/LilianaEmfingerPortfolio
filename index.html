    <h1>Liliana Emfinger</h1>
    <h2>Hello there, my name is Liliana Emfinger. I'm an aspiring fullstack developer. </h2>
    <p>I'm a web dev student at Thinkful. I enjoy coding because I love to be creative and have always loved to use my creativity to problem solve. Making ideas come to life is an amazing privilege, that I can't wait to explore further.</p>
    <p>Besides coding, you can catch me hanging out with family or one of my three dogs, doing a bible study, or just being a foodie in local interesting eatery.</p>
